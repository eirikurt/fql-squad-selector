# To find a player's id, consult data/player_data.json
# Examples based on ids from the 24/25 season
#  - [351] to exclude Haaland
#  - [328] to exclude Salah
#  - [328, 351] to exclude Salah and Haaland

# A more elaborate function, that takes future fixtures into account, would likely yield better results.
